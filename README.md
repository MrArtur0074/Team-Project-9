## Installation

1. **Go to the Releases Page**  
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/MrArtur0074/Team-Project-9/releases) section of this project on GitHub.

2. **Download the ZIP file**  
   Click on the latest version (the one at the top), then find the file that ends in `.zip` (e.g., `Coswalt_v0.1.000.zip`) under **Assets**.  
   Click to download it.

3. **Extract the ZIP archive**
    - On Windows: Right-click the downloaded file → "Extract All..." → choose a folder → click "Extract".
    - Make sure you don’t just open the ZIP file — you need to **extract** it.

4. **Run the application**  
   Open the folder where you extracted the files.  
   Double-click the file named `Coswalt.exe` (it might just show as `Coswalt` depending on your settings).

That’s it! The app should launch.

## Usage

1. Launch `Coswalt.exe`.
2. Set up geometry, airfoils, spars, and ribs.
3. Click **Save** to export drawings.

Airfoil data is loaded from `airfoils.csv` and corresponding coordinate files in the `Airfoils/` directory.
